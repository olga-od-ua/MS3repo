# Baby Noms

[Live project can be viewed here](https://).

The primary goal of the website is to create a platform for recipe storage that is straightforward and easy to use.

The website is aimed at parents of children who start eating solid foods (that is anywhere between 4 and 6 months old) and up until the school age. It is also aimed at any other child caregiver who is willing to find or share a recipe. Users can register and save their favourite recipes.

The recipes can be marked as Approved by The Irish Health Service Executive by users saving the recipe in case they found that recipe on the [HSE](https://www.hse.ie/eng/) website. However, a warning sign will always be informing all users that they will have to check with their child's doctor before giving any food to preserve the safety aspect of using this website.

HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

While there is an abundance of websites with weaning recipes and recipes for children of all ages, not many of them are aiming at recipes shared solely by caregivers. The website provides multiple collections of recipes to choose from in order to help user find the most suitable and most relevant recipes. Some of these collections are: 

 - "Dad's Favourites" (the users add their status or relation to the child in their registration form, so the collection is created from recipes added by Fathers)

  - "Quick Recipes" (created from recipes with cooking time of less than 20 minutes)

  - "Super Quick Recipes" (created from recipes with cooking time of less than 10 minutes)

**The Scope Plane**
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The website is planned to have three main releases as identified in the table below in order to unfold new experiences for the users in the future. 

[ScopePlaneTable.pdf](https://github.com/olga-od-ua/my-full-template/files/6836051/ScopePlaneTable.pdf)

The website has the nav bar that will feature six linear menu elements representing the six self-explanatory main sections of the project, namely:
- Home

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.
