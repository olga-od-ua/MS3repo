# Baby Noms

[Live project can be viewed here](https://).

The primary goal of the website is to create a platform for recipe storage that is straightforward and easy to use.

The website is aimed at parents of children who start eating solid foods (that is anywhere between 4 and 6 months old) and up until the school age. It is also aimed at any other child caregiver who is willing to find or share a recipe. Users can register and save their favourite recipes.

The recipes can be marked as Approved by The Irish Health Service Executive by users saving the recipe in case they found that recipe on the [HSE](https://www.hse.ie/eng/) website. However, a warning sign will always be informing all users that they will have to check with their child's doctor before giving any food to preserve the safety aspect of using this website.

## UX

UX PROCESS

**The Strategy Plane**

THE RESEARCH PHASE

1. The primary goal. 
Baby Noms website is designed to provide a platform for recipes for babies and children starting from introducing solids age up until school age. The users will be able to register, browse recipes, search for recipes, add new recipes and save their favourite recipes to their profile.

2. The users will be able to see suggested recipe collections such as: collections according to age group, meal type, cooking time etc.. This will help the users locate recipes that will be the most suitable for their needs faster.

3. The business objectives of the website are set to attract new customers and promote The Gift Of The Gab School.

4. The customer's estimated needs are to get recipes quicky and easily, save their favourite recipes and add new ones.

### USER STORIES

The target audience are people of all ages who provide childcare to children from the age of starting solid foods up until the school aged children.

## New Users
1. I am Rebecca and I am a new mother to a 6 month old baby. It is time to start introducing solid foods to my baby but I want to see what other parents cook for their babies.

2. I am Stacy and I am a mother to a 5 month old baby. It is time to start introducing solids to my baby but I have no experience in cooking for babies. I want to find recipes that other mothers have tried and loved.

3. I am Anna, a mother-to-be, and I just want to browse the different recipes for babies of different age groups to get an idea about what to expect when the baby arrives.

4. I am Claire and I love cooking for my 9 month old boy! He loves trying new food and I am looking for new recipes that I haven't cooked yet.

5. I am Chris, a dad to 15 month old twins and my wife has left on a business trip for a week. I reassured her that I will do my best to look after our kids so I want to find some easy and nutricious recipes to cook for them.

6. I am Kate and I am looking for the tried and tested recipes for babies and toddlers where I could also save them for future reference.

7. I am Julie, a new mother and I am looking for recipes to cook for my 8 month old girl. I am only looking for recipes that are approved by healthcare professionals.

8. I am Mary and I am a grandmother of 5 grandchildren. I love cooking and I often experiment with recipes for my grandchildren. I am looking for a platform to add and store my recipes so that I can then share them with my children so that they can cook "like their Granny" does.

## Frequent Users

1. I am Barbara and I have all my favourite baby recipes saved in my account. I open it every time I cook for my baby as I am terrible at remembering all the instructions.

2. I am Susan and I love creating new recipes for my grandchildren. I love this website because it lets me easily save my recipes and then share them with my children so they can cook my recipes for their kids. Today I have a new recipe to add.

## Returning Users
1. I am Gloria and I have an account with BABY NOMS. I have just realized that I added a recipe into the wrong age group and I want to move it to the appropriate one.

2. I am Martina and I'd like to delete some of the recipes I have previously shared on this website as I have been adviced by my GP that it is dangerous to give raisins and whole nuts to children under 4 so I want to delete those recipes.


HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

While there is an abundance of websites with weaning recipes and recipes for children of all ages, not many of them are aiming at recipes shared solely by caregivers. The website provides multiple collections of recipes to choose from in order to help user find the most suitable and most relevant recipes. Some of these collections are: 

 - "Dad's Favourites" (the users add their status or relation to the child in their registration form, so the collection is created from recipes added by Fathers)

  - "Quick Recipes" (created from recipes with cooking time of less than 20 minutes)

  - "Super Quick Recipes" (created from recipes with cooking time of less than 10 minutes)

**The Scope Plane**
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The website is planned to have three main releases as identified in the table below in order to unfold new experiences for the users in the future.

   4. Thorough testing was carried out to ensure all website's functionality is correct.

   5. All available friends and family carried out remote testing across multiple devices to share feedback and user experience.

   6. Home page was manually tested:
   
   - all links are working and bring the user to the right pages and in some cases to a certain area on that page (e.g. when clicked on Win a trip to Blarney, the user is brought to the bottom of the Pricing page with the trip to Blarney information)
   - alert message is displayed when clicked on All Irish Accents
   - user is redirected to the Course Info page and the relevant card is flashing when clicked on General Course, Business Course, Hospitality English, Intensive learning, Individual lessons, Group lessons and First Lesson FREE.

### Fixed bugs

1. Background image was the first image to be used as a background image of the body element of the base.html template and an issue was encounteered tthat was not letting the image load. The image in question is /workspace/MS3repo/assets/images/avocados.jpeg. The following methods were tried:

a. body { 
    background: url(/images/avocados.jpeg) repeat 0 0;
}

b. body { 
            background: url("images/avocados.jpeg") repeat 0 0;
        }

c. body { 
            background: url("../images/avocados.jpeg") repeat 0 0;
        }

d. body { 
            background-image: url("../images/avocados.jpeg") repeat 0 0;
        }

e. tried setting min-height: 100%;

f. tried setting background-size: 25px 25px;

g. tried adding the styling directly to the body element in base.html file using the style="" attribute

h. 
 

### Known bugs

Due to the time constraints the following detected bugs have been fixed yet:

1. When a signed-in user tries to share the link to his/her profile, KeyError: 'user' appears when another user tries to follow that link.

2. The close button on the health warning message slightly moves outside the container on small devices.

3. Views of a recipe are added with every click on the materialize icon. This is not the perfect solution as the views are counted every time the collapsible item opens and closes. This means that if a user clicks on the icon to open the collapsible and then clicks on the icon to close the collapsible, 2 views will be added to the recipe.

#### Other
Not a bug but a few remarks on the functionality of the website.

1. Users are not automatically signed out when the window closes for the convenience of not having to log in every time the user opens the website. The majority of users of the website are parents or other childminders, which means that any opportunity to save their time will be appreciated. It was initially planned to have a function that would ask the user whether they forgot to sign out when the user would leave the page. However, after a thorough research, no reliable method to implement such a warning was found. The forced sign out is not currently implemented as there is no sensitive information displayed about the user on any of the website pages. It is planeed to review this feature in the future for possible solutions to improve the website's security.

2. Health warning message appears at the top of every page. It can be closed but it reappears evey time the user is redirected to another page. At first the idea was to give the user the option to only close it once for the duration of the session. However, as irritating as it may be for the user, the decision was made to keep the message reappear in order to keep remindind the user that they should contact their GP for advice when feeding their children.

3. During the development the author included confirm-password input into the Register template without realizing that it gets stored in the Database without any hashing. This security flaw was noticed and rectified.

4. There was an idea to sort recipes by the number of views but this idea was not implemented in order to give all the recipes equal opportunity to be noticed by users. The most reasonable solution for now was to preserve the alphabetical order.

5. Due to the "Add to favourites" function and showing lits of recipes from different categories (def (category_recipes)) it all went into one commit making it a very large commit. Due to time constraints this could not be prevented.

6. At the moment Admin can only add, edit and delete age groups. In the future Admin might be given the opportunity to manage other groups of recipes.

7. It was initially planned to have "HSE approved" group of recipes. However, this group was later removed due to health safety. Users are currently given the option of turning the HSE approved toggle on and off meaning that it is not the most trusted source of medical advice. Hence this group of recipes was removed in order not to encourage relying on this group of recipes as the safest ones. In the future the HSE approved switch access may only be assigned to the admin, or a hired medical professional. At the moment this is not feasible.

8. Views count is not fully functioning on pages other than All Recipes.

9. The following lines of code in recipes.html template are displaying errors:
 - $SCRIPT_ROOT = {{ request.script_root|tojson|safe }};
 - let json_recipes = jQuery.parseJSON({{json_data | tojson | safe}});

 An attempt was made to fix the error by wrapping the result of tojson in quotes, however this created further errors.

## Deployment

> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

## Database 

NB: Initially "Categories" collection had a different role in the project. It would have been more logical to call "Categories" collection "Age Groups" as it only contains Age Groups information in it.

Please find screenshots below:
